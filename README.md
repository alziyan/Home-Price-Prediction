# Bangalore Home Price Prediction WebApp

Welcome to the Bangalore Home Price Prediction WebApp! This project is designed to predict real estate prices in Bangalore using data science and machine learning techniques. The web application allows users to estimate property prices based on various attributes such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location.

## Project Overview

Many real estate websites, like Magicbricks.com, provide property price estimates for different regions. Inspired by this concept, I developed a similar model to predict property prices in Bangalore. The project consists of three main components:

1. **Model Building**: Using sklearn and machine learning algorithms, I built a model based on the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Flask Server**: A Python Flask server was created to handle HTTP requests and serve the saved model.
3. **Frontend**: A web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to input property details and retrieve price predictions from the Flask server.

## Data Science Process

During the development of this project, I utilized various data science concepts including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.

## Technology and Tools Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Numpy, Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: Sklearn
- **Development Environments**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm
- **Backend**: Python Flask for the HTTP server
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Running the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository from GitHub.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alziyan/Bangalore-Home-Price-Prediction.git
